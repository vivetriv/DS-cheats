DS-cheats
==================

A cheat sheet collection of all data science stuff I have learnt so far. This is just a learning exercise for me. For much nicer and comprehensive cheat sheets, install RStudio, load the appropriate package/library and go to *Help > Cheatsheets*.

Packages referenced here include:

* `tidyverse`
* `gapminder`

**Just look at the .md files. Everything else is pretty much useless.**

**Sources:**

*I will eventually make this pretty (eventually...)*
