# Summary:

### Operations for a single dataset

* tidyverse and gapminder are awesome and thought provoking!
* `str(obj)` : shows the structure of an R object.
```{r struct}
str(gapminder)
```

* `names(list)` : Used for naming the different columns for list objects including data frames. Similarly, `ncol()` is equaivalent to `length()`. `nrow()` and `dim()` give number of rows and row x col dimensions of the dataframe. 
* `as_tibble(df)` : a much nicer summary of large dataframes.
```{r tbl_df}
as_tibble(gapminder)
```

* `summary(num_obj/df_col)` : do this to get a sense of scale and dist.
* `plot(dep_var ~ indep_var, df)` : plot two numerical variables from a single dataframe. Syntax is flexible - no need to write df into the second argument if `df$col` used in the first argument. Similar for `boxplot`. `main` and `x/ylab` arguments for the heading and axes labels (respectively) can be added `x/ylim` arguments need to be defined as `c(lower limit, upper limit)` to work. 
```{r boxplot}
boxplot(gdpPercap~year, g, main="Worldwide GDP Per Capita distribution in 55 years (1952-2007)", 
  	xlab="year", ylab="GDP Per Capita", ylim=c(0,57000)) ## g being a copy of the gapminder dataset.
```

* `%>%` : pipe operator. Think "then". Plugs the first/preceding R object into the first argument of a function succeeding it (usually on a different line).
* `rename(df, NewColName = old_col_name)` : Rename columns. 
* `filter(df, col {operator} value)` : filters dataframe for the condition in the second argument. Can add more arguments if multiple filter conditions needed. `{operator}` can be `==`, `>=`, `<`, `!=`, `%in%` and the like.
* `x %in% y`: asks if x is contained in y. Not to be confused with `==` or `=`.
* `select(df, col/condition)` : Ditto `filter()`, with the added ability to subset a dataframe with only certain columns/variables. Use `select(df, col/var, everything())` to bring a variable the left side of the dataframe. `everything()` without a preceding column name `selects` the entire dataframe. Use `select(x:y)` to filter all columns between and including x, but not y. Use `select(-x, -y)` to select everything but columns x and y.
* `mutate(df, new var/col = func)` : defines and inserts new column into the dataframe.
* Percentages and relative quantities hold much more meaning to humans than simply raw numbers.
* `rep(thing, x)` : Replicates (repeats) thing x times.
* `nlevels(x)` : Outputs the number of unique observations in the x column. Actually looks at the number of levels in a factor, each unique observation being given a unique level.
```{r mut_rep}
atib <- g %>%
  filter(country == "Australia")

a_rel <- g %>%
  mutate(tmp = rep(atib$gdpPercap, nlevels(country)),
         gdpPercapRel = gdpPercap / tmp, ## GDP Per Capita relative to Australia
         tmp = NULL) ## Delete the tmp column
```

* `hist(num col/var, probablity = TRUE/FALSE)` : Generates a histogram of given numerical variable with the choice of displaying raw frequencies (default) or probability densities on the y-axis.
```{r hist_07}
RelLatest <- a_rel %>%
  filter(year == "2007")

hist(RelLatest$gdpPercapRel, main = "Distribution of GDP Per Capita relative to Australia in 2007", 
     xlab = "GDP Per Capita relative to Australia", 
     ylab = "Number of countries", 
     breaks = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5))
```

* Put `eval = False` to display code chunks that do not need output or throw errors without cause.
* `arrange(df, var/col)` : arranges dataframe with given variable in ascending order. Use `desc(var/col)` for descending order.
* Analysis code should never assume a particular row order for the data. Ordering rows is nice for human viewing, however.
* `table(col/var)` : Builds a table with frequency of each observations for the specified column.
* `group_by(col/var)` : Distributes the entire dataset into "buckets" allocated according to the levels of the specified variable/s (factor/s). Preferred over `table()` as this func allocates the rows by levels of the var/factor, which makes further analysis simpler. For instance, if `group_by(continent, year)`, imagine buckets labelled *"continent x, year y"* with the corresponding data for all observations for all combinations of the continent-year pairing allocated buckets accordingly.
``` {r gr_summ} 
g %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

* `tally()` : "Tally" up the frequency of observations in each of the "buckets". Could be used the same way as `summarise(n=n())` in the above example.
* `count()` : Count up the frequency of particular observations of a variable in a dataset. Basically, a substitute to `group_by(col/var)` and `tally()` combined.
* `summarise(col = func)` : Ditto `tally()` if used with `n()` as the function defining the column `n`, however, with the added advantages of being able to add and define multiple columns after a comma, preferably on a new line, and also being able to define variables using `mean()`, `median()`, `var()`, `sd()`, `mad()`, `IQR()`, `min()` and `max()`.
* `na.rm = TRUE`: Excludes missing values from analysis when added to the argument of an aforementioned statistical functions following a comma. Opposite action for `FALSE`.
* `n_distinct(col/var)` : Tallies up the frequency of distinct values (levels) of the specified variable (factor) rather than simply the number of observations as with `n()`.
``` {r g_summ_distinct}
g %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            n_countries = n_distinct(country))
```

* `summarise_each(funs(stat_funcs), col/vars...)` : Ditto `summarise()`, but can apply the given statistical functions to multiple variables.
```{r summ_e}
g %>%
  filter(year == c(2002, 2007)) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(mean, median), lifeExp, gdpPercap)
```

* `first(col/var)` : Returns the first value of the specified variable within a group bucket.
  **Caution:** Raw order of the observed values in the dataframe matters. Arrange data, and double-check before applying this function.
``` {r life_gain}
g %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(lifeGain = lifeExp - first(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(lifeGain)
```

* `min_rank(col) {operator} value` : Arranges all observations of the variable in ascending order and returns ranked observations as per the condition in the argument. Use `desc()` for maximum ranked observations. `top_n(1, wt = lifeExp)` works the same as `min_rank(lifeExp == 1)`.
* `print(n=Inf)`: Print all rows of a given output instead of truncating it like in `as_tibble()`.
``` {r rank_func}
g %>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(gdpPercap)) < 2 | min_rank(gdpPercap) < 2) %>% 
  arrange(year, gdpPercap) %>%
  print(n=Inf)
```

* `lag(col/var)`: Returns the next observed value of the group "bucket" variable vector. Opposite of `lead()`, which returns the previous value. **Caution:** Raw order of observed variable values matters.
``` {r lag}
g %>%
  select(year, continent, country, gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(da_sigma = gdpPercap - lag(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(year > 1952) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(da_sigma)) < 3) %>%
  arrange(year, da_sigma) %>%
  print(n=Inf)
```


### Split-Apply-Combine Operations for a single dataset

* `data = {bla}`: Used as an argument in many functions to define and/or filter the data to be used for the analysis. use `.` to include all data. Can also be fed a `subset()` function to filter the data in compute time as an alternative to using multiple piping operators. **Note:** `select()` may not be useful here.
``` {r data}
g %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>%
  t.test(gdpPercap ~ country, data = .)

t.test(gdpPercap ~ country, data = subset(g, continent == "Oceania"))
```

* `nest()` : Collapses the non-grouping variables into a list-column type variable for further analysis.
* `df[row, col]` : Returns the specified component of the given data frame. Blank arguments give entire rows or columns. Names or numbers can be used.
* `df$col[row_number]` : Returns the value/s in the specified place.
``` {r nest_1}
gNested <- g %>%
   group_by(continent, country) %>% 
   nest()

gNested[132,]
gNested$data[132]
```

* `lm(var1 ~ var2, data = {bla})` : Fits a linear regression model over the given data. `I(var2 - {<smallest value})` denotes the x-axis values and helps set the y-intercept close to the lowest y-axis data value (and not intrapolate values).

``` {r}
leYr <- function(df) {
  lm(lifeExp ~ I(year - 1950), data = df)
}

leYr(gNested[[132, "data"]])
```
**Notice** the double square brackets? I have no idea why they exist...

* `map(data, func)` : Applies the given function to the specified data.
``` {r map}
gNFilt <- gNested[1:5,]

gNFilt
  
gLmMut <- gNFilt %>%
  mutate(Lm = map(gNFilt$data, leYr))

gLmMut
```
**Note:** Notice the `=` in the `mutate` argument instead of `<-`. This names the new column `Lm` instead of `Lm <- map(gNFilt$data, leYr)`. In other uses, `<-` for simply assigning a vector (rather than a column) would suffice.

* `tidy()` : Turns a list into a tidy dataframe type object.
* `unnest()` : Opposite of `nest()`. Expands a df/list-column type object to fill tidy up a previously nested df (i.e. one observation per column).
``` {r de_nest}
str(gLmMut$Lm[[3]]) # list
str(gLmMut$data[[3]]) # tbl_df, df, tbl
typeof(gLmMut$data[[3]]) # list
tidyFrame <- tidy(gLmMut$Lm[[3]]) #df

gFiltCoef <- gLmMut %>%
  select(continent, country, Lm) %>% 
  unnest(map(Lm, tidy))

gFiltCoef
```

* ``col = recode(col, `{old_value}` = "new_value", ...)`` : Changes a value in the given column into another value. Works for factor, character and numeric values. See `?dplyr::recode` for a lot more.
* If an inline code block has a `` `this` `` thing in it, use ` `` ` to begin and end the code block.
``` {r recode}
gFiltCoef %>%
  mutate(term = recode(term, `(Intercept)` = "intercept", `I(year - 1950)` = "slope"))
```
